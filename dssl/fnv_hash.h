 * fnv_32_buf - perform a 32 bit Fowler/Noll/Vo hash on a buffer

 * input:

 *	len	- length of buffer in octets
 *	hval	- previous hash value or 0 if first call
 *
 * returns:
 *	32 bit hash as a static hash type
 *
 * NOTE: To use the 32 bit FNV-0 historic hash, use FNV0_32_INIT as the hval
 *	 argument on the first call to either fnv_32_buf() or fnv_32_str().
 *
 * NOTE: To use the recommended 32 bit FNV-1 hash, use FNV1_32_INIT as the hval
 *	 argument on the first call to either fnv_32_buf() or fnv_32_str().
