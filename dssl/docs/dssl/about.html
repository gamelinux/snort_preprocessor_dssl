<h2 align="center">About DSSL</h2>
	<p>DSSL is a SSL traffic decryption and TCP reassembly toolkit, implemented as a cross-platform C library. Currently, DSSL is built and tested on Linux and Microsoft Windows platforms. </p>
	<p>DSSL provides application developers with the functionality to reassemble captured network packets into TCP streams, and, if the traffic is SSL-encrypted, decrypt the data (provided with SSL serverâ€™s private key). After that, the reassembled and decrypted data can be analyzed by the user application.</p>
