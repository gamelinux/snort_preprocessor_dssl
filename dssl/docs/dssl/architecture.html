	<h2>DSSL Architecture Overview</h2>
	<p>DSSL library consists of the following functional parts:</p>
	<h3>Packet Processing Layer</h3>
	<p>Packet layer receives captured network packets and process the link (Ethernet) 
	and network (IP) protocols, detects TCP packets and directs them to the TCP 
	layer.</p>
	<h3>TCP layer</h3>
	<p>TCP layer resolves packet's TCP session object using a table of all active TCP 
	sessions it maintains. Then, the session packets are sorted and reassembled 
	into client-to-server and server-to-client TCP streams.</p>
	<p>When a new chunk of reassembled data becomes available, the TCP layer passes it 
		to the data callback routine for further processing. For plaintext TCP traffic (no SSL), the output from TCP session reassembly is 
		headed directly to user-provided callback function for application-level 
		processing. If SSL encryption is present, the reassembled traffic first passes 
		through the SSL Decryption layer before it reaches the application.</p>
	<h3>SSL decryption layer</h3>
	<p>This module reconstructs the SSL protocol carried over its input TCP payload 
	data. Then, using SSL serverâ€™s private key provided, it decrypts the SSL 
	payload and passes the decrypted plaintext to the application-defined callback 
	routine for processing.</p>
	<p>SSL Decryption layer's design allows it to be used independently from the other 
		parts of the library. This simplifies the task of adding SSL encryption support 
		for applications that already have their own TCP reassembly and session 
		management code.</p>
